::About HyFont Studio::
HyFont Studio is a new Global Type Design Division of Kika Tech, Inc. Our goal is to design fonts for all languages in the world. The name "HyFont" is from "Hyphen" which is a punctuation mark used to joint words, and to separate syllables of a single word. It's like our motto "Change a Word, Change the World." We will use fonts to connect the world.
